# My-Account-Balance
The program you are given takes an account number and its balance as input. It defines Account class with 1 member balance and derives User class from it with 1 additional member - the account number, then creates a user object and tries to store the balance and account number in it, and shows the details. But something is wrong. Fix the program so that it completes the User() constructor, which should assign the parameters to the corresponding members of the User class. Also, check the access modifier of balance member of Account class.
